Intelligent System For Identifying Leaf Diseases In Soybean Crop


The system allows the farmer to take photos from leafs in the soybean crop, register date, time, lat-long coordinates and diagnost result from inference performed by the microcontroller. All data is saved in a SD Card.

Later, when the farmer has computer and internet facilities, he can open Microsoft BI interface, analyse the results of the photos, diagnostics, where the photos were collected in a google earth satelite map, and access information and reports on how to mitigate the disease.

Figure below shows the Intelligent System For Identifying Leaf Diseases In Soybean Crop process flow.
